# annespotspourri

A simple static website for my mom's pottery business. Heavily work in progress at this time, but has been a fun back-to-basics learning experince about static hosting. In my day-to-day web development work there are lots of frameworks and build procesess and bundling, and I wanted to try and make a dead simple project without spinning up some completely overpowered framework.

Note: This was built from a clone of the [s3 static starter kit repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-workshops/tree/master/WebApplication) and I will continue to reference its initial layout for design inspiration.

### The goals:
* Allow potential customers and fans of my mom's work to see her past and upcoming events
* Showcase her work in a gallery of some sort
* Embed posts and link out to her social media
* Make a contact form for custom work requests and a general mailing list
* Do all of this with free, third party tools to keep the project complexity as low as possible
